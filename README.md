BOT_AI is an application where the user can chat with an AI model. Beyond this, the user should be able to give some feedback at each stage of the conversation.
This feedback is multi-fold.
- The user can like/dislike the AI model's answer using the thumbs up/thumbs down buttons. These buttons are hidden and float when the mouse hovers over the AI model's response.
- The user can give a rating out of 5 at the end of the conversation. You can get creative here and use a likert scale, or 5 stars, etc.
- The user can give subjective feedback at the end of the conversation.

The user can have multiple such conversations.
Once the user is done having that conversation, the chat gets saved. This chat can be revisited from a panel on the side/top bar. While viewing a past conversation, the user can see the feedback provided.
